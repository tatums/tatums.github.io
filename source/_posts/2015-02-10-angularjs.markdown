Lately I've been writing a lot of angularjs.  At my work, we had a great debeate.. which client side framework should we use.  It came down to angularjs or ember. Ultimately, we choose angular.  I'm happy we did.  Angularjs is awesome.  I would have been just as happy to settle with ember. Two way binding is a game changer.

Rails is great, BUT, I feel that, in any rails app, you end up creating interfaces that are a reflection of your database. Adding a client side framework, you're free to create interfaces that are decoupled from your backend.
