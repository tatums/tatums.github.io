Lately I've been doing a lot of server administration. It can be a lot of fun automating systems. One thing I've found super valuable is to setup a "message of the day" file. This will display immediately after login and can be found in `/etc/motd`.  I like to put notes/documentation here. For example, I'll put in how to restart redis, how to tag a deploy, or the path to the app.
