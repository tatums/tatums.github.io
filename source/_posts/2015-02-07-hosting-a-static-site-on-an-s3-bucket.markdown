I love the recent shift from dynamic sites to static sites. This doesn't work for all sites. But why have a blog that gets dynamically build on each request.  It's Not needed.

Amazon will host static sites on an S3 bucket and its dead simple. Awesome!

1. Create a bucket and set as public host.
3. Upload files and make them public.
4. Profit.
